### What is the Difference Between Hardware Revisions?

Due to supply chain issues, weâ€™ve changed one of the components in the device in hardware revision 3.0.0. Otherwise, there is no functional difference in this revision. The 3.0.0 units began shipping on January 4th, 2022, for Logic Pro 16 only.

All older revisions are supported by all releases of the Logic 2.x and Logic 1.x software.
