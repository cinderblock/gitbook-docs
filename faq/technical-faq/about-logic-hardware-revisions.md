### What is the Difference Between Hardware Revisions?

* Revision 3.0.0 - Due to supply chain issues, weâ€™ve changed one of the components in the device in hardware revision 3.0.0. Please note that hardware revision 3.0.0 requires the Logic software version 2.3.42 or newer, and does not support the legacy 1.x software. The 3.0.0 units began shipping on January 4th, 2022, for Logic Pro 16 only.
* Revision 2.0.0 - There is no functional difference between Revision 2.0.0 and 1.0.0. Specifically, one component we originally used in revision 1.0.0 was discontinued, and therefore, an equivalent replacement was designed in.
* Revision 1.0.0 - This is the original launch revision of the hardware.
