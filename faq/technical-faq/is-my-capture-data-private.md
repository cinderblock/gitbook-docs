# Is My Capture Data Private?

{% hint style="info" %}
The information provided in this article applies to the latest production software downloadable [here](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/).

The [Logic 1](https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/latest-beta-release) and [Logic 2](https://discuss.saleae.com/) versions of the software collect some additional usage data that are not mentioned in this article, though captured data is never shared with us. The user can opt-out of providing such usage data via the Options menu.
{% endhint %}

We understand that many of our customers work on confidential projects. Because of this, captured data is never shared with us.

Please note that the Logic software communicates with our servers in the following ways:

* Crash Reports - If a software crash occurs, you will be prompted with a pop-up box asking if you'd like to send the crash report to us. This is never done automatically.
* Device ID - Each time Logic is used on a new PC, its unique device ID is collected to download the calibration file for that particular device. You can learn more about this in the link below:

{% page-ref page="../../user-guide/device-calibration.md" %}

* Software Updates - The Logic software checks to see if a newer version is available for download. It does not automatically download it. Instead, a notification to the user is provided in the Options dropdown. Automatically checking for updates can be disabled by navigating to Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Interaction tab.
* Usage Statistics - If this setting is enabled, usage statistics is sent to our servers. Please remember that captured data is never sent to us. The user can opt-out of providing such usage data via the Options menu.
