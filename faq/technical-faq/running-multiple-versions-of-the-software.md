## Running Multiple Versions of the Software

If you need to work in an environment with multiple versions of the Saleae Logic software, we recommend using standalone installs, which can be installed side-by-side, instead of using the normal installed software where only one version can be installed at once.

Look for stand-alone versions of the current software and older versions here:
