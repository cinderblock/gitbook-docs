# Does Saleae Have a Trade-In or Upgrade Plan?

Saleae does not offer a trade-in or upgrade plan. However, if you purchased a device within the last 180 days, you can return it for a full refund (including shipping both ways). That will allow you to upgrade or downgrade your product at any time in the first 6 months after buying it. Feel free to [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more information.
