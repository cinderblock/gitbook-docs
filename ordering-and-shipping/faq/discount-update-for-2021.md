# Discount Update for 2021

You may have noticed that the [discounts](https://blog.saleae.com/saleae-discounts/) we currently offer for our logic analyzers have recently been updated as of August 2021. This was unfortunately a necessary response to the current supply chain crisis that is impacting us in various ways, such as increased costs across the board.

We certainly want to continue doing our part in providing an affordable logic analyzer for those who may have limited financial resources, most notably for students, enthusiasts, contractors, and small startups. The good news is that we have not changed the discount we offer for Logic 8! In addition, we're happy to continue offering [quantity discounts](https://support.saleae.com/ordering-and-shipping/what-discounts-are-available), as well as discounts for our Logic Pro 8 and Logic Pro 16 models \(albeit not the same discount amount that we could provide in the past\).

Feel free to [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in case you have any questions about the discount updates. We'd be happy to chat!
