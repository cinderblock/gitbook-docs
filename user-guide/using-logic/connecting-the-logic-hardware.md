# Connecting the Logic Analyzer

1. Open the Logic software
2. Connect one end of the included USB cable to the Logic analyzer
3. Connect the other end of the USB cable to the PC's USB port. Ensure that the proper USB port is used for the specific device. Due to the amount of bandwidth required, it is recommended to directly connect to the PC's USB port rather than through a docking station or a USB hub.
   * Logic Pro 8 and Logic Pro 16 require a USB 3.0 port.
   * Logic 8 requires at least a USB 2.0 port.
   * Our discontinued products \(Original Logic, Logic16, and Logic 4\) require at least a USB 2.0 port.
4. Once connected to the PC, the software will begin configuring the device and the LED on Logic should turn on.
