# Time Bar Settings

The time bar located at the top of the software helps with visualizing the time at which events occur in your capture. In addition, right-clicking on the time bar will allow configuration with regards to how time is displayed.

### Setting the Time Relative to Events

The time point at which t=0s occurs can be configured to the following events

* **Start of Capture**: Sets the start of the capture as t=0s
* **Digital Trigger**: In a digital triggered capture, this sets the point at which the digital trigger occurs as t=0s
* **Analyzer Trigger**: If the trigger was the result of an Analyzer Trigger \(located under the Analyzers panel &gt; Trigger View\), then the point at which the trigger occurred will be t=0s.
* **Timing Marker**: If any timing markers are present, then the selected timing marker will be set as t=0s.

### Wall Clock Format

* **Wall Clock Time**: Changes the time format to your OS wall clock

### Time Preferences

The Time Preferences may also be opened for further customization on the time bar behavior.
