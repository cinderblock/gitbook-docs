    &#x20; System Management Bus
*   SWD

    &#x20; Serial Wire Debug
*   UNI/O

    &#x20; (not an acronym), a protocol made by Microchip
*   USB LS/FS

    &#x20; Universal Serial Bus Low Speed / Full Speed
*   Baud rate

    &#x20; data rate measured in bits per second
*   MSB

    &#x20; most significant bit
*   LSB

    &#x20; least significant bit
*   Parity

    &#x20; additional information added to the data to provide error detection information
*   Processing backlog

    &#x20; In the Saleae software, the data recorded from the device is transformed to the storage format as it is recorded, in near-real time. If the process is unable to keep up with the recording in real time, the processing backlog will grow as unprocessed data are buffered.
*   Trigger backlog

    &#x20; In the Saleae software, when the trigger is used, the processed data are then fed into the trigger in near real-time. If the trigger thread is unable to process the already transformed data in real time, the trigger backlog will grow as processed (but not yet searched) data are buffered.
*   MHz (Megahertz)&#x20;

    &#x20; Millions of cycles per second. It is a measure of frequency, usually in reference to bandwidth.
*   Protocol Analyzer

    &#x20; A software plugin for the Saleae software that will decode standardized signals into bytes.
