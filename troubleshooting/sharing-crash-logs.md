# Sharing your Software Crash Logs

Our support team may request for a copy of the software logs generated by the Logic 2 app during crashes. These log files can be found in the location below:

```
On Windows 10:
    C:\Users\<Your User Name>\AppData\Roaming\Logic\Logic\logs
On MacOS:
    ~/Library/Logs/Logic2/
On Linux Ubuntu:
    ~/.config/Logic/logs
```

You should find files with names like "graphio-2021-11-11--09-43-49.log." The log files are named after when the software was started. We would like to get the logs from when you experienced the crashes, but if you're not sure which ones those are, feel free to zip and send us the whole set.
