### Contacting Support

#### Contact Us From Within the App

If the software can start properly, but crashes during operation, please first ensure that you are using the latest version of the [Logic 2 software](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/). If that doesn't solve the crashes, please feel free to reach out to us from within the app (if the app allows). We will follow up with your request via email.

When contacting us from within the app, we will be interested in the following information.

* Which product(s) you were using when the software crashed
* Indicate if this is a new problem or if you have always experienced this problem.
* Describe what you were doing when the crash/bug occurred. For example, did it occur at the beginning / during / after a capture? Is the crash/bug repeatable? If so, what are the steps leading up to the crash?
* Include any other relevant information not listed above that might help us uncover the bug. The app allows you to submit a screenshot of the app-view in case that helps.

### **Common Solutions**

Please try the following solutions first before contacting support.

* Remove all active protocol analyzers
  * This solution may help when the software crashes immediately after the Start button is clicked, and might indicate a buggy protocol analyzer.
* Remove unused channels
* Disable 'Decoded Protocol Search' (Options -> Preferences -> Capture Tab)
* Run the Logic software as administrator
* Delete the settings.xml file. It may be corrupt. See instructions below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you can find and delete settings.xml, make the file visible first.

* On Windows - Showing hidden files and folders should be enabled. [Instructions Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files)
* On OSX - Showing the Library folder should be enabled. [Instructions Here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8137224?answerId=8137224021#8137224021)
