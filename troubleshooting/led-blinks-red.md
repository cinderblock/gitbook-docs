# Saleae Logic LED Blinks Red

{% hint style="info" %}
If the Saleae Logic LED blinks red while connected to a MacOS computer, please contact us right away. Usually, this indicates faulty hardware.
{% endhint %}

If the Saleae Logic LED blinks red, then the firmware did not load properly. The firmware is loaded to the Logic hardware every time it is connected to the PC and when the Logic software is started. You will notice a percentage indicator at the top of the software while the firmware is loaded.

The red LED blinking could be caused by several factors listed below.

* Incompatible USB host controller on the PC
* Faulty USB cable
* Hardware failure

### Tests to Run

* Ensure you are running the [latest version of the Logic software](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/).
* Test Logic on another PC. This may help rule out a potential hardware issue.
* Test another USB cable.
* If the above steps fail, please try the older, unsupported, Logic v1.2.29. The download link is provided below.
