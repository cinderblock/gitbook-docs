# Error Message: Unable to detect WebGL

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that **both** [WebGL v1](https://webglreport.com/?v=1) and [WebGL v2](https://webglreport.com/?v=2) need to be supported by your PC's hardware \(typically the graphics card\) to properly run the Logic 2 software.
{% endhint %}

Upon launching the Logic 2 software, an error message may appear, stating the following:

`Unable to detect WebGL, please contact support`

This may indicate older PC hardware that is not supported by our software. This could be caused by the following:

* Operating System, and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit
* Graphics card
* CPU

### WebGL Requirements to Run Logic 2

You can test your PC's WebGL support by following the links below. Both WebGL v1 and v2 need to be supported by your PC's hardware.

* [WebGL v1](https://webglreport.com/?v=1)
* [WebGL v2](https://webglreport.com/?v=2)

### Workaround

At the moment, the workaround is to use our older Logic 1.x software. Download link is below:
