# Linux Permission Requirements for Logic Software

{% hint style="info" %}
This support article only applies to versions 1.2.18 and prior. We highly suggest updating your software to [Logic 2](https://ideas.saleae.com/f/changelog/) to avoid the Linux permission issues described below. A udev rules file \(or equivalent\) is still required to access Saleae devices.

### Running Logic 1.2.18 and Prior Versions

The Logic 1.2.18 \(and prior\) software on Linux requires write permissions to several directories in order to run. These directories are relative to the Logic binary and need to exist for the software to run. They are not automatically generated by the software.

These directories are:

* Directory containing the Logic binary
* .\Databases
* .\Errors
* .\Settings
* .\Calibration \(this directory is generated by the software and may not be present before the software is run for the first time\)

The software also requires read access to all files and folders that are in the same directory as the binary, including:

* .\Analyzers
* .\libAnalyzer.so

The Drivers folder is not used by the software and not required. It contains a udev rules file and an installer script.
