# Issues with the Apple M1 Chip

We have received a handful of reports of some stability issues when using our Logic 2 software with Apple's new M1 chip. The new ARM-based M1 chip is currently found in the new MacBook Air, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro released in late 2020.

Please let us know if you are experiencing these issues via the methods below:

### Known Workaround

Please try using our older Logic 1.x software \(v1.2.29\). Download link below. This version of the software provided stable operation in our tests. If the version below continues to fail, please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### Our Test Results

We tested all of our logic analyzers on the new Macbook Pro \(13-inch, 2020, M1 chip\). In our tests, our logic analyzers periodically failed on the Logic 2 software via ReadTimeout errors during captures. The Logic 1.x software \(linked above\) provided stable performance.

We plan to update the Logic 2 software to support Apple's M1 chips in the future. In the meantime, please use our older Logic 1.x software if you are experiencing these issues.
