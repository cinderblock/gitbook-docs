# Sharing your Machine ID

In some cases, our support team may request for your machine ID to investigate bugs on the [Logic v2 software](https://ideas.saleae.com/f/changelog/).

To find your machine ID, click on the Options button on the bottom-right, then click "About."

![Click Options &amp;gt; About to Open the &quot;About&quot; Window](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-11-at-6.08.00-pm.png)

Afterwards, the "About" window should appear. You can click the "Copy" button to copy the build info text, including your Machine ID, to your clipboard. You can then paste it in your response to our support team when requested.
